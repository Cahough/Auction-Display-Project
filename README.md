# Auction Display Project
Auction Display Project is a project created to help display exhibitor, buyer, addon buyer, and sale information during a county fair auction. The application is comprised of a front-end web application server, a back-end api server, and a database server that can all be run on a host machine inside of a local network. The system is designed to connect with other computers or Raspberry PI or similar devices that act as endpoints for displaying the data on a monitor(s).

## Technologies
Auction Display Project is built using a _**MEVN**_ stack which consists of:
* **MongoDB** ([NoSQL](https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained?jmp=footer)) for the database system and database server
* **Express.js** for the Node.js web application framework
* **Vue.js** for the front-end, client-side web server
* **Node.js** for the primary back-end server functionality
